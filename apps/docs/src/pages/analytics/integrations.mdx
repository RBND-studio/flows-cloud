# Integrations

Flows automatically track how users interact with your flows. You can either view this data in aggregated form in the dashboard [insights section](/analytics/flow-insights) or integrate with your favorite analytics tools to get more control and flexibility.

## Setup

To integrate with your analytics tool, you need to pass a `tracking` function to the `init` function. This function will be called with an `event` object every time a user interacts with a flow.

```js
init({
  projectId: "xxx",
  // Pass a function and call an API or use a library.
  tracking: (event) => {
    fetch("https://my-analytics.example.com", {
      method:"POST",
      body: event
    })
  }
})
```

The `event` has the following shape.

```ts
interface TrackingEvent {
  type: "startFlow" | "nextStep" | "prevStep" | "finishFlow" | "cancelFlow";
  flowId: string;
  /**
   * Index of the step in the flow.
   * @example
   * - 0 - First step
   * - 1 - Second step
   * - [2, 1, 0] - First step (0) in the second branch (1) of the third step (2)
   * - [2, 1, 1] - Second step (1) in the second branch (1) of the third step (2)
   * - 3 - Fourth step
   */
  stepIndex?: number | number[];
  /**
   * Hash of the step definition.
   */
  stepHash?: string;
  /**
   * Hash of the whole flow definition.
   */
  flowHash: string;
  /**
   * userId you've passed to the init function.
   */
  userId?: string;
  /**
   * projectId you've passed to the init function.
  */
  projectId: string;
  /**
   * Browser location
   * @example
   * - "/" - Root
   * - "/checkout"
   * - "/search?query=foo" - Query params are included
   */
  location: string;
}
```

## Events

- `startFlow`: When a user starts a flow.
- `nextStep`: When a user goes to the next step in a flow.
- `prevStep`: When a user goes to the previous step in a flow.
- `finishFlow`: When a user finishes a flow.
- `cancelFlow`: When a user exits the flow without completion.
