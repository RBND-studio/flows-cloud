# Integrations

Flows automatically track how users interact with your flows to help you better understand how users are engaging with your product. When the built-in [insights](/analytics/flow-insights) are not enough, you can easily integrate with almost any analytics tool to get the full picture of your users' behavior.

## Setup

To integrate Flows with your analytics tool, pass a `tracking` function to the Flows `init` function. The `tracking` function will be called every time a user interacts with your flows.

```js
init({
  projectId: "xxx",
  // Pass a function and call your tool's API or use a library to send the event.
  tracking: (event) => {
    fetch("https://my-analytics.example.com", {
      method: "POST",
      body: event,
    });
  },
});
```

When the function is called, it will receive an `event` object with information about the user interaction. The `event` object has the following shape:

```ts
interface TrackingEvent {
  type: "startFlow" | "nextStep" | "prevStep" | "finishFlow" | "cancelFlow";
  flowId: string;
  /**
   * Index of the step in the flow.
   * @example
   * - 0 - First step
   * - 1 - Second step
   * - [2, 1, 0] - First step (0) in the second branch (1) of the third step (2)
   * - [2, 1, 1] - Second step (1) in the second branch (1) of the third step (2)
   * - 3 - Fourth step
   */
  stepIndex?: number | number[];
  /**
   * Hash of the step definition.
   */
  stepHash?: string;
  /**
   * Hash of the whole flow definition.
   */
  flowHash: string;
  /**
   * userId you've passed to the init function.
   */
  userId?: string;
  /**
   * projectId you've passed to the init function.
   */
  projectId: string;
  /**
   * Browser location
   * @example
   * - "/" - Root
   * - "/checkout"
   * - "/search?query=foo" - Query params are included
   */
  location: string;
}
```

## Events

These are the events that Flows will send to your tracking function:

- `startFlow`: When a user starts a flow.
- `nextStep`: When a user goes to the next step in a flow.
- `prevStep`: When a user goes to the previous step in a flow.
- `finishFlow`: When a user finishes a flow.
- `cancelFlow`: When a user exits the flow without finishing it.

## Examples

Here is an example of how you can send events from Flows to Mixpanel for analysis:

```js
init({
  projectId: "xxx",
  userId: "abc",
  tracking: (event) => {
    mixpanel.track(
      event.type, // What happened
      {
        flowId: event.flowId, // What flow the user is interacting with
        stepIndex: event.stepIndex, // What step they are on
        location: event.location, // What page they are on
        userId: event.userId, // Optional: Mixpanel automatically adds user properties to events when you use mixpanel.identify
      },
    );
  },
});
```
