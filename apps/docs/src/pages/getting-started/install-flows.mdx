# Install Flows

<Tabs items={["React","JS snippet (CDN)", "NPM package"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

Install the Flows SDK library via a NPM package manager.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js
```

Create Flows component and initialize it with your project ID.

```jsx
"use client";

import { init } from "@flows/js"; 
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const Flows = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    init({
      // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
      projectId: "xxxx"
    });
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

Lastly don't forget to render the Flows component in the root of your application (`layout.tsx` or `App.tsx`)

This is the simplest way to install Flows. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet bellow and paste it within the `<head>` tag of your product - ideally right before the closing `</head>` tag.

<LatestScript />

When you're done, you can start using Flows by calling `flows.init()` anywhere in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```html
<script>
  flows.init({
    // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
    projectId: "xxxx"
  });
</script>
```

Once the snippet is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and launching them in your product.

Install the Flows SDK library via a NPM package manager.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @flows/js
```

And then import it in your code. You can find the `projectId` in your project settings.

```js
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  // Insert your Flows Cloud projectId
  projectId: "xxxx"
});
```

Once the library is installed, you can start creating onboarding flows and launching them in your product.

## Verify installation

You can verify installation by defining demo flow in your `init` function call. This flow will be started automatically when the Flows SDK is loaded.

```js
init({
  // --- ADD THIS ---
  flows: [
    {
      id: "hello-world",
      // Makes the flow start automatically on any page
      location: "/",
      steps: [
        {
          title: "Hello, world!",
          body: "This is a modal step, to show tooltip instead add <em>targetElement: '.my-element'</em> to this step.",
          // Uncomment and replace with your element selector to show a tooltip instead of a modal
          // targetElement: ".my-element",
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
  // --- END OF DEMO FLOW ---

  // Your projectId from previous step
  projectId: "...",
})
```

You should now see a modal when you open any page with Flows initialized. If it doesn't show up, please check the browser console for any errors.

To verify connection with Flows Cloud, you should now see a `hello-world` flow inside your Flows Cloud project with one start event. If not, try checking the browser console.

{/* ## Set up a proxy (optional) */}

{/* We recommend setting up a proxy to load flows from Flows Cloud, so they're less likely to be intercepted by ad blockers. There are several options for creating a reverse proxy, including Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify. */}

{/* TODO: add simple article for proxy process */}
