# Identify users

For flows to show up only once to a user, you need to identify the user. This is done by passing a `userId` parameter to the `init` function. This will allow you to count unique users that have seen your flows and show the flows only once to a specific user.

```js
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  // Unique identifier for the user
  // Prefer database ID over email if you're concerned about privacy of your users
  userId: "xxxx"

  projectId: "...",
})
```

The `userId` parameter can be any unique identifier for the user. We recommend using a database ID or a UUID. We hash the user ID on the client side before sending it to our servers to protect your users' privacy.

## Adding user properties

To target your flows to specific users, you can optionally pass user properties to the `init` function. These properties can be used to target flows to specific users based on their properties.

```js
import { init } from "@flows/js";

init({
  userId: "xxxx",
  projectId: "...",
  userProperties: {
    email: "john.doe@flows.sh"
    name: "John Doe",
    plan: "premium"
  },
})
```

To protect your users' privacy Flows donâ€™t store any personal data about your users. When you setup targeting based on user properties the evaluation is done on the client side. This means that the user data is never sent to our servers.

## Reset user progress

You can reset which flows has user already seen either by calling a function from the SDK or by entering `userId` manually in the Flows cloud.

### Reset from SDK

To reset from SDK make sure you [identify user first](#). Calling one of the following functions will reset the progress for the given `userId`.

```js
import { resetFlow, resetAllFlows } from "@flows/js"

// Reset single flow
resetFlow("my-flow")

// Reset all flows
resetAllFlows()
```

### Reset from Flows cloud

{/* TODO: make sure this reflects the actual workflow after UI review is made */}
{/* TODO: currently it resets all flows, we can easily add option to reset single flow (implemented on the BE) */}

Open your project settings for the project you want to reset the user progress for. Enter the `userId` you want to reset the progress for and click the "Reset user progress" button.
